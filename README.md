PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH CLASSIFICATION
Utilize a dataset with labeled data and apply classification algorithms to build predictive
models. Preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and explore various
classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or
support vector machines. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1- score, and compare their performances to determine the most suitable
algorithm
