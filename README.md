The task that assign to me is:
PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH CLASSIFICATION
Utilize a dataset with labeled data and apply classification algorithms to build predictive
models. Preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and explore various
classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or
support vector machines. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1- score, and compare their performances to determine the most suitable
algorithm.

I have done the machine learning model creation in this task. I gain the practical knowledge while completing the task.
